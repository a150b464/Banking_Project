/*
	/////////////////////LISTS //////////////////////////
	 * Stored lists of objects
	 * Duplicates are allowed
	 * Elements are indexed via an integer
	 * 	Checking for particular items in a list is slow
	 * Looking up an item through index is fast
	 * Iterating through Lists is relatively fast
	 * It can be sorted if you want
	 
	 List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<String>();
	 
	/////////////////////// SETS //////////////////////////////////////
	 * Only stores unique values
	 * Not Indexes unlike lists
	 * Very fast if you want to check if an item exists
	 * If you want to use your own objects , implement hashcode and equals method
	 * Order is not important and OK if it changes
	 * Hashset :not ordered
	 * Treeset: sorted in natural order, must implement comparable for custom types
	 * LinkedHashset: stores order in which they were added
 
 	//////////////////////MAPS ///////////////////////////////
 	 * Key value pairs
 	 * Retrieving a value by key is fast
 	 * Iterating over Map values is very slow
 	 * Iterating over Map keys is fast
 	 * Implement hashcode and equals if using own objects as Keys
 	 * Hashmap: Keys not in any specific order and liable to change
 	 * Treemap: Keys sorted in natural order
 	 * LinkedHashMap: Keys stored in order added
 	 * SortedSet and SortedMaps
